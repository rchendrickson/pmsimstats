}
\arguments{
\item{basesavename}{The basesavename as described in \link{generateSimulatedResults}}

\item{savedir}{The directory the files are saved in}

}
\description{
\code{reknitsimresults} recombines the results of simulations that have the
exact same parameter space set, but were run as separate chunks - e.g., you
ran 100 repititions, realized you needed more, and ran 150 more to have 250
total. Does not work with rawdataout.
