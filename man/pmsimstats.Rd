\title{Personalized medicine stimulation-based statistics}
\description{
The \code{pmsimstats} package is a simple set of tools to
help with implementing simulation-based powercalculations and
bias assessments the ability of different clinical trial
designs to answer personalized medicine (or precision medicine)
oriented hypotheses - specifically, the ability of a
