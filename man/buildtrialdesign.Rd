\title{Build your proposed clinical trial design}
\usage{
buildtrialdesign(
  name_longform,
  name_shortform,
  timepoints,
  timeptnames,
  expectancies,
  ondrug
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name_longform}{A name that will clearly remind you what this trial
design is. Can have spaces, etc. If not provided, will default to "Trial
Design 1"}

\item{name_shortform}{An abbreviated version of the name that can be used
on plots, in your code when you want to select a certain trial design, etc.}

\item{timepoints}{A numeric vector containing the timepoints (not including
baseline) at which anything of relevance happens in your trial design. You
must specify any timepoint where a measurement will be taken, the participant's
expectancy about what intervention they are receiving changes, or the actual
intervention itself (e.g. all randomizationpoints) can change.
NOTE: The unit used is not specified - you must just ensure that the unit you
use here is consistent with the unit used for e.g. the halflife of any
carryover effect. Typical units would be weeks or days.}

\item{timeptnames}{A character vector containing brief labels for each of the timepoints.
If your trial has different phases, it can be helpful to incorporate those into the
timepoint names for later easy reference. It is helpful if they are short enough to
use as x-axis labels on a plot. If not specified, will default to "V1, V2, V3..." for
Visit 1, Visit 2, etc.}

\item{expectancies}{A numeric vector with all values ranging from 0 to 1, of the same length
as timepoints. These values represent the "expectancy" a participant has at any given
point that they are receiving active, effective treatment. It can match the probability
that a participant is receiving active treatment (e.g. 0.5 for 1:1 randomization of
active drug to placebo), but does not have to. It is used to scale the degree of the
expectancy-related response factor.}

\item{ondrug}{A list containing binary vectors that describe when participants are on active
treatment or not (whether they are on a placebo or not is irrelevant for this paramater).
Each vector is same length as the number of timepoints, and specificies that someone
is either on active treatment at that timepoint (1) or not on active treatment at that
timepoint (0). Each possible path through the trial is described by a separate vector.
E.g., an open label trial will only have one path (a list with one vector, which contains
all 1's), a traditional parallel group RCT would have 2 paths (all 1's and all 0's), and
a trial with two randomization points would have 4 paths.}
}
\value{
\code{output$metadata} contains the input variables you used for future reference,
  named as above.

\code{output$trialpaths} contains a list whose length is defined by the number
  of paths through the clinical trial (ie, the length of the input variable ondrug, above),
  containing the information about the trial in the form required by the pmsimstat tools.
}
\description{
\code{buildtrialdesign} inputs the details of a proposed clinical trial
design in an intuitive way and outputs those details in a structured form
that can be used by the pmsimstat package simulation tools
